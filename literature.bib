	abstract = {Over the past decade, the European Union has lost the trust of many citizens. This article investigates whether and how media information, in particular visibility and tonality, impact trust in the European Union among citizens. Combining content analysis and Eurobarometer survey data from 10 countries between 2004 and 2015, we study both direct and moderating media effects. Media tone and visibility have limited direct effects on trust in the European Union, but they moderate the relation between trust in national institutions and trust in the European Union. This relation is amplified when the European Union is more visible in the media and when media tone is more positive towards the European Union, whereas it is dampened when media tone is more negative. The findings highlight the role of news media in the crisis of trust in the European Union.},

	abstract = {The question of what is important when we evaluate movies is crucial for understanding how lay audiences experience and evaluate entertainment products such as films. In line with this, subjective movie evaluation criteria ({SMEC}) have been conceptualized as mental representations of important attitudes toward specific film features. Based on exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of self-report data from online surveys, previous research has found and validated eight dimensions. Given the large-scale evaluative information that is available in online users’ comments in movie databases, it seems likely that what online users write about movies may enrich our knowledge about {SMEC}. As a first fully exploratory attempt, drawing on an open-source dataset including movie reviews from {IMDb}, we estimated a correlated topic model to explore the underlying topics of those reviews. In 35,136 online movie reviews, the most prevalent topics tapped into three major categories—Hedonism, Actors’ Performance, and Narrative—and indicated what reviewers mostly wrote about. Although a qualitative analysis of the reviews revealed that users mention certain {SMEC}, results of the topic model covered only two {SMEC}: Story Innovation and Light-heartedness. Implications for {SMEC} and entertainment research are discussed.},

	title = {Gender Inequality in the Movie Industry:},
	abstract = {The current study aimed to evaluate gender inequality in the movie industry. The gender of the cast and top crew positions from all 4885 feature films that received a wide release in United States between 1982 and 2017 were evaluated. Data was collected by scraping online movie databases. In the first part of the study, three types of representation were considered. First, the analysis of the numerical representation confirmed that there is high gender inequality in both cast and crew. Second, the examination of the quality of these representations revealed that, while all genres are male dominated, comedy, drama, romance and music have a higher proportion of women that the other genres (female genres). An analysis using the Bechdel test, used as a measure of female independence, showed that most movies from female genres pass the test, while movies from other genres fail it. Third, the analysis of the centrality of the representations showed no significant difference between big and small studio size, as both were male dominated. The relationship between cast and crew indicated that a higher proportion of women in the crew increases the proportion of women in the cast, especially for female genres. Finally, the second part of the study evaluated the relationship between the cast and crew’s gender and movie success. Overall, more women in the cast is associated with lower online review scores, awards and tickets sold, while the effect for female crew is positive on online ratings.},

We hypothesize that print and online articles differ in terms of news values because of differences in the routines used to produce them. Based on a quantitative automated content analysis of N = 762,095 Dutch news items, we show that online news items are more likely to be follow-up items than print items, and that there are further differences regarding news values like references to persons, the power elite, negativity, and positivity. In order to conduct this large-scale analysis, we developed innovative methods to automatically code a wide range of news values. In particular, this article demonstrates how techniques such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, supervised machine learning, and automated queries of external databases can be combined and used to study journalistic content. Possible explanations for the difference found between online and offline news are discussed.},

Therefore, online health information has remained an umbrella term encompassing different platforms (expert- vs. peer-generated). A hybrid method that combines qualitative and computational methods is used to identify different topics discussed on these different platforms, and an initial model of patients’ social support needs was developed and applied to data obtained from the hybrid method. Using topic modeling (Nposts = 52.990), topics on two expert- and two peer-generated platforms were identified. Differences between and within platforms were found. While peer-generated platforms mainly covered interaction on emotional support topics, expert-generated platforms covered informational topics. Within peer-generated platforms, patients used their experiences differently.},

@article{ha_automatically_2021,
	abstract = {Visual social media have emerged as an essential brand communication channel for advertisers and brands. The active use of hashtags has enabled advertisers to identify customers interested in their brands and better understand their consumers. However, some users post brand-incongruent content---for example, posts composed of brand-irrelevant images with brand-relevant hashtags. Such visual information mismatch can be problematic because it hinders other consumers' information search processes and advertisers' insight generation from consumer-initiated social media data. This study aims to characterize visually mismatched content in brand-related posts on Instagram and builds a visual information mismatch detection model using computer vision. We propose a machine-learning model based on three cues: image, text, and metadata. Our analysis shows the effectiveness of deep learning and the importance of combining text and image features for mismatch detection. We discuss the advantages of machine-learning methods as a novel research tool for advertising research and conclude with implications of our findings.},

We show how a multiscale and sliding window approach can be efficiently implemented within a {ConvNet}. We also introduce a novel deep learning approach to localization by learning to predict object boundaries. Bounding boxes are then accumulated rather than suppressed in order to increase detection confidence. We show that different tasks can be learned simultaneously using a single shared network. This integrated framework is the winner of the localization task of the {ImageNet} Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 ({ILSVRC}2013) and obtained very competitive results for the detection and classifications tasks. In post-competition work, we establish a new state of the art for the detection task. Finally, we release a feature extractor from our best model called {OverFeat}.},

@article{meppelink_reliable_2021,
	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the applicability of supervised machine learning ({SML}) to classify health-related webpages as `reliable' or `unreliable' in an automated way.
Methods: We collected the textual content of 468 different Dutch webpages about early childhood vaccination. Webpages were manually coded as `reliable' or `unreliable' based on their alignment with evidence-based vaccination guidelines. Four {SML} models were trained on part of the data, whereas the remaining data was used for model testing.
Results: All models appeared to be successful in the automated identification of unreliable (F1 scores: 0.54--0.86) and reliable information (F1 scores: 0.82--0.91). Typical words for unreliable information are `dr', `immune system', and `vaccine damage', whereas `measles', `child', and `immunization rate', were frequent in reliable information. Our best performing model was also successful in terms of out-ofsample prediction, tested on a dataset about {HPV} vaccination.
Conclusion: Automated classification of online content in terms of reliability, using basic classifiers, performs well and is particularly useful to identify reliable information. Practice implications: The classifiers can be used as a starting point to develop more complex classifiers, but also warning tools which can help people evaluate the content they encounter online. {\copyright} 2020 The Authors.

@article{zhang_whose_2019,
	abstract = {This study focuses on the outpouring of sympathy in response to mass shootings and the contestation over gun policy on Twitter from 2012 to 2014 and relates these discourses to features of mass shooting events. We use two approaches to Twitter text analysis---hashtag grouping and supervised machine learning ({ML})---to triangulate an understanding of intensity and duration of ``thoughts and prayers,'' gun control, and gun rights discourses. We conduct parallel time series analyses to predict their temporal patterns in response to features of mass shootings. Our analyses reveal that while the total number of victims and child deaths consistently predicted public grieving and calls for gun control, public shootings consistently predicted the defense of gun rights. Further, the race of victims and perpetrators affected the levels of public mourning and policy debates, with the loss of black lives and the violence inflicted by white shooters generating less sympathy and policy discourses.},

	abstract = {Despite the online availability of data, analysis of this information in academic research is arduous. This article explores the application of supervised machine learning ({SML}) to overcome challenges associated with online data analysis. In {SML} classifiers are used to categorize and code binary data. Based on a case study of Dutch employees' work-related tweets, this paper compares the coding performance of three classifiers, Linear Support Vector Machine, Na{\"\i}ve Bayes, and logistic regression. The performance of these classifiers is assessed by examining accuracy, precision, recall, the area under the precision-recall curve, and Krippendorf's Alpha. These indices are obtained by comparing the coding decisions of the classifier to manual coding decisions. The findings indicate that the Linear Support Vector Machine and Na{\"\i}ve Bayes classifiers outperform the logistic regression classifier. This study also compared the performance of these classifiers based on stratified random samples and random samples of training data. The findings indicate that in smaller training sets stratified random training samples perform better than random training samples, in large training sets (n ¼ 4000) random samples yield better results. Finally, the Linear Support Vector Machine classifier was trained with 4000 tweets and subsequently used to categorize 578,581 tweets obtained from 430 employees.},

	abstract = { The era of Big Data has begun. Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what `research' means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases.

This special issue discusses the validity of using big data in communication science and showcases a number of new methods and applications in the fields of text and network analysis. Computational methods have the potential to greatly enhance the scientific study of communication because they allow us to move towards collaborative large-N studies of actual behavior in its social context. This requires us to develop new skills and infrastructure and meet the challenges of open, valid, reliable, and ethical ``big data'' research. By bringing together a number of leading scholars in one issue, we contribute to the increasing development and adaptation of computational methods in communication science.},

@inproceedings{BERT,
	abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5{\%} (7.7{\%} point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

@article{Wieland2021,
abstract = {Journalistic media increasingly address changing user behaviour online by implementing algorithmic recommendations on their pages. While social media extensively rely on user data for personalized recommendations, journalistic media may choose to aim to improve the user experience based on textual features such as thematic similarity. From a societal viewpoint, these recommendations should be as diverse as possible. Users, however, tend to prefer recommendations that enable “serendipity”-the perception of an item as a welcome surprise that strikes just the right balance between more similarly useful but still novel content. By conducting a representative online survey with n = 588 respondents, we investigate how users evaluate algorithmic news recommendations (recommendation satisfaction, as well as perceived novelty and unexpectedness) based on different similarity settings and how individual dispositions (news interest, civic information norm, need for cognitive closure, etc.) may affect these evaluations. The core piece of our survey is a self-programmed recommendation system that accesses a database of vectorized news articles. Respondents search for a personally relevant keyword and select a suitable article, after which another article is recommended automatically, at random, using one of three similarity settings. Our findings show that users prefer recommendations of the most similar articles, which are at the same time perceived as novel, but not necessarily unexpected. However, user evaluations will differ depending on personal characteristics such as formal education, the civic information norm, and the need for cognitive closure.},

@article{Kim2019,
abstract = {Abstract Recommendation algorithms are widely used in online cultural markets to provide personalized suggestions for products like books and movies. At the heart of the commercial success of recommendation algorithms is their ability to make an accurate prediction of a target person's preferences for previously unseen items. Can these algorithms also be used to predict which health messages an individual will evaluate favorably, and thereby provide effective tailored communication to the person? Although there is evidence that message tailoring enhances persuasion, little research has examined the effectiveness of recommendation algorithms for tailored health interventions aimed at promoting behavior change. We developed a message tailoring algorithm to select smoking-related public service announcements (PSAs) for smokers, and experimentally test its effectiveness in predicting a target smoker's evaluations of PSAs and encouraging smoking cessation. The tailoring algorithm was constructed using multiple levels of data on smokers' PSA rating history, individual differences, content features of the PSAs, and other smokers' PSA ratings. We conducted a longitudinal online experiment to examine its efficacy in comparison to two non-tailored methods: “best in show” (choosing messages most preferred by other smokers) and “off the shelf” (random selection from eligible ads). The results showed that the tailoring algorithm produced more accurate predictions of smokers' message evaluations than the simple-average method used for the “best in show” approach. Smokers who viewed PSAs recommended by the tailoring algorithm were more likely than those receiving a random set to evaluate the PSAs favorably and quit smoking. There was no significant difference between the “best in show” and “off the shelf” methods in message assessment and quitting behavior.},

The sheer amount of data and the unique features of digital content call for the application of valuable new techniques. Various other scholarly fields are already applying computational methods to study digital journalism data. Often, their research interests are closely related to those of journalism scholars. Despite the advantages that computational methods have over traditional content analysis methods, they are not commonplace in digital journalism studies. To increase awareness of what computational methods have to offer, we take stock of the toolkit and show the ways in which computational methods can aid journalism studies. Distinguishing between dictionary-based approaches, supervised machine learning, and unsupervised machine learning, we present a systematic inventory of recent applications both inside as well as outside journalism...},

Communication accommodation theory, for example, suggests that conversation partners' verbal (and non-verbal) behaviors become more similar as relationships develop. Using a corpus of 1+ million text messages that 41 college-age romantic couples sent to each other during their first year of dating, this study examines how linguistic alignment of new romantic couples' CMC changes during relationship formation. Results from nonlinear growth models indicate that three aspects of daily linguistic alignment (syntactic—language style matching, semantic—latent semantic analysis, overall—cosine similarity) all exhibit exponential growth to an asymptote as romantic relationships form. Beyond providing empirical support that communication accommodation theory also applies in romantic partners' CMC, this study demonstrates how relational processes can be examined using digital trace data.},

Compared to previous work, 3bij3 gives researchers control over the recommendation system under study and creates a realistic environment for the participants. It integrates web scraping, different methods to compare and classify news articles, different recommender systems, a web interface for participants, gamification elements, and a user survey to enrich the behavioural measures obtained.},
