*Grading is based on the quality of the written Method Section and Result Section.*

#### a. Method Section

- In the Method section, it should be clear *which variables* were selected and why. In addition, the *data preprocessing* steps to clean and prepare the data to enable feature engineering should be clearly described.

|---|---|---|---|
|     The assignment does not mention which   variables are included/ excluded, and/or a rationale for selecting variables is   absent and/ or preprocessing steps are not clearly explicated.    |     The assignment mentions which variables   are included, and which ones are excluded.

A clear and convincing rationale   for inclusion/ exclusion is present. In addition, the preprocessing steps are   clear and convincingly described; it becomes clear why and how the data was   preprocessed.           |     The assignment mentions which variables   are included, and which ones are excluded.

- The Method section should explain the *analytical strategy* (i.e., the type of analytical strategy to be used to explore the dataset, such as visualizing the data, providing summary statistics with regards to variables, and/or using an inductive technique for text analysis, such as LDA to describe topics present in the data).
