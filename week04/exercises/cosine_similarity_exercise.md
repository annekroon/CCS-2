# Exercises

1. Run the code in the [notebook](../resources/cosine_sim.ipynb). Do you understand all the steps?
2. Replace the `str` objects in `doc1` and `doc2` for different sentences (that you can make up yourself). Do you expect high or low similarity? Run the cells, and inspect the results. Are findings in line with what you expected?
3. Play around with different type of `vectorizer`s (e.g., compare `count` and `tfidf`). Does this influence the results, and how?
4. Finally, can you transform the output to `cosine distance?``
