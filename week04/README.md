# Week 4

This week we will delve into inductive techniques of text analysis. More specifically, we will explore measures of text similarity: Cosine Similarity and Soft Cosine Measure. In addition, we will offer a practical introduction to topic modelling (latent dirichlet allocation).

For this week's lab session, we invite you to:

- Practice with the [basics of cosine and soft cosine](https://github.com/annekroon/CCS-2/blob/main/week04/exercises/cosine-similarity-basics.ipynb).
- Practice with the [basics of LDA models](https://github.com/annekroon/CCS-2/blob/main/week04/exercises/topic-modelling.ipynb).
- OPTIONAL: If you are interested, we also [prepared a notebook](https://github.com/annekroon/CCS-2/blob/main/week04/exercises/OPTIONAL_overtime_similarity.ipynb) that will help you estimate cosine/ soft cosine scores on a larger sample of news articles, and map variance over time. Please consider this as an additional resource that may help you if you want to use these techniques in, for example, your bachelor thesis. We do not expect you to understand all the code in this notebook.
